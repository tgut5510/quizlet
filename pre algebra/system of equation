system of equation
set of equation with same variable

system of equation solution
input both equation into graph; line interception determine x & z

one solution
line intersect once

zero solution
parallel line

infinite solution
same line

slope intercept form
z = slope x + z-intercept

solve system of equation with graph
cancel x solve for z-intercept then cancel z solve for x-intercept; solution when both equation plot

solve system of equation with substitution
