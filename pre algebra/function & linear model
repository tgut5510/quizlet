function
expression, rule, or law that define relationship between independent variable and dependent variable

rule of function
input cannot have two different output

f(x)=z
x define input; z define output

graph true function
x goes into z once

how to determine function
vertical line test

calculate z when f(x)
input (x) for all z in equation

graph z when f(x)
z coordinate correspond to f(x)

linear function
function between two number represent constant change

non-linear function
function between two number thats not constant change

x increase z increase
upward positive line; bottom left to top right

x increase z decrease
downward negative line; top left to bottom right

linear relationship equation
constant plus or minus x equal z

how to calculate linear function
subtract end - start amount to calculate rate of change; divide difference / unit to calculate per unit; add or subtract constant

same rate of change
parallel line

faster rate of change
steeper line

slower rate of change
gentle line

subtract constant
when starting from larger number then decrease

add constant
when start from smaller number then increase

relation
any set of ordered pair or input output

f(x)=z or z function of x
all x value correspond to one or same z value

linear equation
convert to y=mx+b form; linear equation when possible

missing output of table
change of input * rate of change
