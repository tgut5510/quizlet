unit rate
denominator or second quantity equal one

slope intercept formula
z = slope (x coordinate) + z-intercept

point slope formula
z-z1 = mx (x-x1)

slope formula
z2-z1 / x2-x1

proportional relationship of graph
line through origin

coordinate plane
coordinate system formed at intersection of horizontal x-axis and vertical z-axis

coordinate pair
ordered pair of number to locate point on coordinate plane; (x,z)

how to graph slope intercept form
graph constant (z-intercept) then rise / run slope to get next point

how to calculate x / z intercept from equation
set one variable equal to zero then solve for other

x-intercept
z = 0

z-intercept
x = 0

what determine line steepness
absolute value of slope

rise or run equal zero
zero slope

calculate slope from equation
convert to slope intercept form; m=slope

+z / x positive slope
up z then right x

-z / x negative slope
down z then right x

x equal equal number
x coordinate does not change; vertical line

z equal one number
z coordinate does not change; horizontal line

calculate constant from two coordinate pair
solve for slope; input coordinate pair into slope intercept formula to solve for constant

f(x) = z
when x equal number z equal number
